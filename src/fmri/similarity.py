        Computes an overall consistency score across multiple similarity blocks.

        Each block is assumed to be a square similarity matrix (subjects × subjects)
        representing one experiment or condition.

        The function measures how consistent the relative distances/similarities
        are across all blocks — i.e., whether pairs that are close in one experiment
        also tend to be close in others.

        The metric used is the average Spearman correlation between
        the upper-triangular (non-redundant) parts of all blocks.
